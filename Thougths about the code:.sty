Thougths about the code:

GENERAL
    The code has already been proved to work.
    Maybe ask Ian about ho to do the canity checks, could be good for the master thesis for proving and not just assuming.


PRIMER 
- Primer sites are randomly given by the Possion distribution:
- you as a user can not input the primerconcentration --> maybe we could change that ? to make it more accurate 

TEMPLATE
- concentration ? 


TEMPERATURE



CYCLES



ANNEALING

QUESTIONS:
- How does the code make sure that we only have the barcode once ?
    We cant make sure that it is truly unique, jsut like in real experiment 
- Why do we add the N to an extra varaible ? 
    To add the unique barcode in the end 
- Why do we use posion distribution ? 
    It is the easiest to use 
- initialize_sites, first loop i 100 what does it mean ?
    Just to give an update were the code is rigth now 
- On what is the MS based on ? What is it ?
    MS stands for main sequence. The number 136 is based on the average calculation.
    It is used as a cutoff to see if the sequences are neighbors 
- What is the difference between CNS and MS cut off ?
    CNS stands for candidate neighbor seauence. It is the sequence the mainsequence is compared to.
- What is the rejection threshold ?

- What does this Random.seed!(1234); due ?

- Annealing block in firt cycle ? why both times sequence b?
    Dont know, should investigate if it is maybe a silent error 
    
 - What is i_no ? what does it count ?
